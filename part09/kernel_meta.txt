\begintext

    This meta file contains the relative paths to all needed SPICE kernels.
    For each tutorial we will set up an individual kernel_meta.txt. A common
    meta file could be easily stored in the main folder (next to the _kernel
    directory), however it would be over-loaded at some point.

KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (
    '../_kernels/pck/gm_de431.tpc',
    '../_kernels/spk/de432s.bsp',
    '../_kernels/lsk/naif0012.tls',
                  )
