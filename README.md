# Note
This is forked from the [``Space Science Tutorial`` repo by Thomas Albin](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/SpaceScienceTutorial). Among them, I skipped Parts 09/11 (simple visualization that maybe fun for students)

If you are a beginner in python, I think their original materials and exhaustive "medium" articles will be great learning material for you.

I tried to change code lines to my taste in this repo, so this repo is a "*summarized version of the original material, for intermediate-level python users who have basic knowledge on space science.*"

Later, I may try looking into their youtube materials and merging them here.
