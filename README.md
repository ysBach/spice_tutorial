# Note
This is forked from the [``Space Science Tutorial`` repo by Thomas Albin](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/SpaceScienceTutorial).

If you are beginner in python, I think their original materials and exhaustive "medium" articles will be a great learning material for you.

I tried to change code lines to my taste in this repo, so this repo is a "summarized version of the original material, for intermediate-level python users, who have basic knowledge on space science."

Later, I may try looking into their youtube materials and merge them into here.
