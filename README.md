# Note
This is forked from the [``Space Science Tutorial`` repo by Thomas Albin](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/SpaceScienceTutorial).
1. Part 01: Basics of spiceypy
1. Part 02: Movement of the Solar system barycenter (SSB, id=1) over time with respect to the Sun.
1. Part 03: SSB-planet distance for Giant planets, find correlation between SSB-Sun-planet angle (Jupiter governs the SSB location)
1. Part 04: A practice to find "observable window" (using phase angles of Sun, Earth, Venus, Moon)
1. Part 05: A practice to plot Sun, Venus, Mars, Moon on Ecliptic and Equatorial coordinate (aitoff)
1. Part 06: Calculating the "state vectors", orbital elements, conversion matrix between reference frames (``ECLIPJ2000``), and orbit of an NEO.
1. *(Part 07: Merged into Part 08)*
1. Part 08: Query IAUMPC comets DB, add some info, save as SQL DB
1. *(Part 09: Omitted because it's a simple visualization that maybe fun for students)*
1. Part 10: A practice to calculate T_Jup parameter in e-i space for different a, make a GIF.
1. *(Part 11: Omitted because it's a simple visualization that maybe fun for students)*
1. *(Part 12: Omitted because it's a simple visualization that maybe fun for students)*
1. Part 13: 67P orbital (osculating) elements calculation near Jupiter encounter, compare with IAUMPC.
Among them, I skipped Parts 09/11/12 (simple visualization that maybe fun for students)

If you are a beginner in python, I think their original materials and exhaustive "medium" articles will be great learning material for you.

I tried to change code lines to my taste in this repo, so this repo is a "*summarized version of the original material, for intermediate-level python users who have basic knowledge on space science.*"

Later, I may try looking into their youtube materials and merging them here.
