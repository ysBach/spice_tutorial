\begintext

    This meta file contains the relative paths to all needed SPICE kernels.
    For each tutorial we will set up an individual kernel_meta.txt. A common
    meta file could be easily stored in the main folder (next to the _kernel
    directory), however it would be over-loaded at some point.
